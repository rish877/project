            <h3>About the Water Quality Index (WQI)</h3>
            <p>The Water Quality Index (WQI) is a numerical measure used to assess the overall quality of water in a specific area or water body. It provides valuable information about the suitability of water for various uses, such as drinking, recreation, and aquatic life support.</p>
            <h3>Components of the WQI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="some">Data Collection: To calculate the WQI, various water quality parameters are measured and monitored. These parameters can include physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water.</li>
                <li>Parameter Weighting: Each parameter is assigned a specific weight or importance factor based on its significance to water quality and its potential impact on human health or the environment.</li>
                <li>Data Standardization: To compare different parameters, the data for each parameter is often standardized using a scale or conversion formula.</li>
                <li>Sub-Index Calculation: For each parameter, a sub-index is calculated based on its measured value and the relevant weight. The sub-index represents the individual quality of that parameter.</li>
                <li>WQI Calculation: The sub-indices for all parameters are combined to calculate the overall Water Quality Index. This is usually done by taking a weighted average of the sub-indices.</li>
                <li>WQI Categories: The WQI value is often categorized into different classes, such as excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor, to help users understand the water quality at a glance.</li>
                <li>Interpretation and Action: The WQI value and its corresponding category help authorities, researchers, and the public understand the health of a water body. Depending on the category, appropriate actions can be taken.</li>
                <li>Regular Monitoring: Water quality is dynamic, and regular monitoring and assessment using the WQI are essential to track changes in water quality and identify trends or potential problems.</li>
